  <title>Statements and Connectives</title>

  <p>
    Symbolic logic studies some parts and relationships of natural language by representing
    them with symbols. The main ingredients of symbolic logic are <term>statements</term>
    and <term>connectives</term>.
  </p>
<definition xml:id="def-Statement">
  <statement>
  <p>
    A <term>statement</term> is an assertion that can be either true or false, but not both.
  </p>
  </statement>
</definition>


  <example xml:id="example-statements">
    <title>Statements and Non-Statements</title>
    <p>The following sentences are statements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is sunny today.</li>
      <li>Ms. W. will have a broader audience next month.</li>
      <li>I did not join the club.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Questions (for example, “How’s the weather?”), interjections (for example, “Cool!”),
      and incomplete sentences (for example, “If I could …”) are not considered to be
      statements unless rephrased appropriately.
    </p>
  </example>

  <p>
    <term>Simple statements</term> do not contain other statements as parts.
    All of the examples above are simple statements.
    We typically represent simple statements using lowercase letters
    <m>p, q, r, \ldots</m>.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-simple-statements">
    <title>Symbolic Representation of Simple Statements</title>
    <p>
      Let
      <m>s</m> represent “Your bicycle is slick,” and
      <m>c</m> represent “I like its color.”
    </p>
  </example>
<definition xml:id="def-">
  <statement>
    <p>
          <term>Connectives</term> join simple statements into more complex statements,
    called <term>compound statements</term>.
    The most common connectives and their symbols are:
   </p>

  <ul>
    <li><term>and</term>, <term>but</term>: <m>\land</m></li>
    <li><term>or</term>: <m>\lor</m></li>
    <li><term>if … then</term>: <m>\to</m></li>
  </ul>
  
  </statement>
</definition>
  


  <example xml:id="example-conjunction">
    <title>Conjunction</title>
    <p>
      “Your bicycle is slick and I like its color” is written symbolically as
      <m>s \land c</m>.
    </p>
  </example>

  <p>
    The operation <term>not</term>, written <m>\lnot</m>, turns a single statement into
    its negation. It is not a connective.
  </p>

  <p>
    The symbols representing statements, connectives, and negation form our
    <term>logical dictionary</term>. Parentheses are used for punctuation.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-logical-operations">
    <title>Statements and Their Logical Forms</title>
    <ul>
      <li><m>p:\hspace{1cm}</m> <m>p</m> is true (assertion)</li>
      <li><m>\lnot p:\hspace{1cm}</m> <m>p</m> is false (negation)</li>
      <li><m>p \land q:\hspace{1cm}</m> <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> (conjunction)</li>
      <li><m>p \lor q:\hspace{1cm}</m> either <m>p</m> or <m>q</m>, or both (disjunction)</li>
      <li><m>p \to q:\hspace{1cm}</m> if <m>p</m> then <m>q</m> (conditional)</li>
    </ul>
  </example>

  <p>
    The connective <term>or</term> has an <term>inclusive</term> meaning in logic.
    For example, “Bob will play tennis or go to the movies” means that Bob may do
    one, the other, or both.
  </p>

  <p>
    The connective <term>but</term> plays the same logical role as <term>and</term>
    and is represented by the same symbol <m>\land</m>.
    For example, “Your bicycle is slick, but I don’t like its color” is written as
    <m>s \land \lnot c</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The use of parentheses is essential and requires careful attention.
    Consider the following compound statement:
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-parentheses">
    <title>The Role of Parentheses</title>
    <p>
      If I do a web search for pages containing the terms “termites” or “cattle,”
      then I will search for pages containing “global warming.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Define the simple statements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><m>t</m>: I search for pages containing “termites.”</li>
      <li><m>c</m>: I search for pages containing “cattle.”</li>
      <li><m>g</m>: I search for pages containing “global warming.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The symbolic form of the compound statement is
      <m>(t \lor c) \to g</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without parentheses, the expression <m>t \lor c \to g</m> would represent a
      different and unintended meaning.
    </p>
  </example>

    <title>Convert English Statements into Symbols</title>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Convert each compound statement into a symbolic statement. For each part,
        assign symbols to each simple statement (for example,
        <m>f</m> = “my favorite dish has lots of anchovies”), then use the appropriate
        connectives (<m>\land</m>, <m>\lor</m>, <m>\lnot</m>, <m>\to</m>).

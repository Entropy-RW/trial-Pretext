  <title>Statements and Connectives</title>
  
  
  <p>
    Symbolic logic studies some parts and relationships of natural language by representing
    them with symbols. The main ingredients of symbolic logic are <term>statements</term>
    and <term>connectives</term>.
  </p>
<definition xml:id="def-Statement">
  <statement>
  <p>
    A <term>statement</term> is an assertion that can be either true or false, but not both.
  </p>
  </statement>
</definition>


  <example xml:id="example-statements">
    <title>Statements and Non-Statements</title>
    <p>The following sentences are statements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is sunny today.</li>
      <li>Ms. W. will have a broader audience next month.</li>
      <li>I did not join the club.</li>
    </ul>
  </example>
  <example xml:id="example-notstatements">
    <title>Non-Statements</title>
    <p>The following sentences are <term>NOT</term> statements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What time is it?</li>
      <li>Listen!</li>
      <li><m>x+5=9</m>.</li>
    </ul>
    <hint>
      <p>
      Questions, interjections (for example, “Cool!”),
      and incomplete sentences (for example, “If I could …”) are not considered to be
      statements unless rephrased appropriately.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </example>
  <p>
    <term>Simple statements</term> do not contain other statements as parts.
    All of the examples above are simple statements.
    We typically represent simple statements using lowercase letters
    <m>p, q, r, \ldots</m>.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="example-simple-statements">
    <title>Symbolic Representation of Simple Statements</title>
    <p>
      Let
      <m>s</m> represent “Your bicycle is slick,” and
      <m>c</m> represent “I like its color.”
    </p>
  </example>
<definition xml:id="def-">
  <statement>
    <p>
          <term>Connectives</term> join simple statements into more complex statements,
    called <term>compound statements</term>.
    The most common connectives and their symbols are:
   </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Conjunction (and, but) : <m>\land</m></li>
    <li>Disjunction (or) : <m>\lor</m></li>
    <li>Conditional (if..., then): <m>\to</m></li>
  </ul>
  
  </statement>
</definition>
  


  <example xml:id="example-conjunction">
    <title>Conjunction</title>
    <p>
       Suppose <m>s</m> and <m>c</m> represent the following statements:
      </p> <p> <m>s =</m> “Your bicycle is slick,” </p>
    <p>
      <m>c =</m> “I like its color.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your bicycle is slick and I like its color” is written symbolically as
      </p>
      <me>s \land c</me>.
  </example>
      <example xml:id="example-disjunction">
    <title>Disjunction</title>
    <p>
       Suppose <m>s</m> and <m>c</m> represent the following statements:
      </p> <p> <m>s =</m> “Your bicycle is slick,” </p>
    <p>
      <m>c =</m> “I like its color.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your bicycle is slick or I like its color” is written symbolically as
      </p>
      <me>s \lor c</me>.
  </example>

  <warning>
<p>
  In everyday English, the connective <term>or</term> is sometimes used in an
  <term>exclusive</term> sense, meaning that exactly one of the options is true.
  In contrast, the connective <term>or</term> in logic has an
  <term>inclusive</term> meaning.
  Thus, the statement “Bob will play tennis or go to the movies” means that Bob may
  play tennis, or go to the movies, or do both.
</p>
</warning>
<definition xml:id="def-not">
  <statement>
    <p>
      The operation <term>not</term>, symbolically written <m>\lnot</m>, turns a single statement into
    its negation. It is not a connective.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>
  <note>
    <p>
    The connective <term>but</term> plays the same logical role as <term>and</term>
    and is represented by the same symbol <m>\land</m>.
    For example, “Your bicycle is slick, but I don’t like its color” is written as
    <m>s \land \lnot c</m>.
  </p>
  </note>

  <p>
    The symbols representing statements, connectives, and negation form our
  logical dictionary. Parentheses are used for punctuation.

<warning>

  <p>
    The use of parentheses is essential and requires careful attention.
    Consider the following compound statement:
  </p>
  

  <example xml:id="example-parentheses">
    <title>The Role of Parentheses</title>
    <p>
      If I do a web search for pages containing the terms “termites” or “cattle,”
      then I will search for pages containing “global warming.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Define the simple statements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><m>t</m>: I search for pages containing “termites.”</li>
      <li><m>c</m>: I search for pages containing “cattle.”</li>
      <li><m>g</m>: I search for pages containing “global warming.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The symbolic form of the compound statement is
      <m>(t \lor c) \to g</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without parentheses, the expression <m>t \lor c \to g</m> would represent a
      different and unintended meaning.
    </p>

    In the following questions, translate between English statements and symbolic logic.
    You may choose your own letters for simple statements, as long as you define them clearly.
  </p>

  <question xml:id="q-english-to-symbolic-a">
    <statement><p>Jim is a lawyer, yet he is not a crook.</p></statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Let <m>l</m> = “Jim is a lawyer” and <m>c</m> = “Jim is a crook.” Then <m>l \land \lnot c</m>.</p>
    </solution>
  </question>

  <question xml:id="q-english-to-symbolic-b">
    <statement><p>Although our professor is young, he is knowledgeable.</p></statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Let <m>y</m> = “Our professor is young” and <m>k</m> = “Our professor is knowledgeable.” 
        Then, the answer is <m>y \land k</m>.</p>
    </solution>
  </question>

  <question xml:id="q-english-to-symbolic-c">
    <statement><p>My favorite dish has lots of anchovies or is not spicy and also it comes in a large portion.</p></statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Let <m>a</m> = “My favorite dish has lots of anchovies,” <m>s</m> = “My favorite dish is spicy,” and <m>l</m> = “My favorite dish comes in a large portion.”

  <question xml:id="q-english-to-symbolic-d">
    <statement><p>My favorite dish has lots of anchovies and it comes in a large portion or it is spicy and it also comes in a large portion.</p></statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Using the same symbols as <xref ref="q-english-to-symbolic-c"/>, the statement is <m>(a \land l) \lor (s \land l)</m>.</p>
    </solution>
  </question>

  <question xml:id="q-english-to-symbolic-e">
    <statement><p>If you do not attend class, then either you read a book or you will not pass the exam.</p></statement>

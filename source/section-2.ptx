    <p>Create a voting system:
 How we cast votes 
 How we decide the outcome</p>

    <title>Voting Theory</title>
    <p>The mathematics of elections
First half is voting – how we cast our vote
Second half is counting – how we decide the outcome</p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>The Paradoxes of Democracy</title>
    <p>The paradox is that the more opportunities we have to vote, the less we seem to appreciate and understand the meaning of voting.
Why should we vote?
Does our vote really count?
How does it count?</p>

    <title>The Elements of an Election (1 of 2)</title>
    <p>Candidates – can be people, places, movies, pizza toppings, etc.
Voters – people with a say in the outcome
Ballots – means of expressing your vote
Single choice – pick one!
Preference ballot – rank all candidates
Truncated preference ballot – rank a specific number of candidates</p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>The Elements of an Election (2 of 2)</title>
    <p>Outcome
Winner only
Partial ranking
Full ranking
Voting method – how we tabulate the ballots to produce an outcome; how we handle a tie
Most complicated part of the election 
Must be agreed upon ahead of time as different methods may produce different outcomes</p>

    <title>Example-The Math Club Election (1 of 5)</title>
    <p>Holding its annual election for president.
four candidates: Alisha, Boris, Carmen, and Dave (A, B, C, and D for short). 
Each member of the club is eligible to vote. 
the vote takes the form of a preference ballot.
Each voter is asked to rank each of the four candidates in order of preference.</p>

 Preference ballots submitted are shown here.</p>

    <title>Properties of Preference Ballots</title>
    <p>A candidate in a higher position is always preferred over a candidate in a lower position.

Relative preferences do not change 
if one of the candidates withdraws</p>

    <title>What should we do with Ties?</title>
    <p>Possibilities:
allow it to stand, having more than one winner,
have a run-off election,
award the win to the candidate with fewer last-place votes,
determine the head-to-head winner between the tying candidates,
flip a coin!</p>

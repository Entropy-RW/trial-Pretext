  <title>Statements and Connectives</title>

  <p>
    Symbolic logic studies some parts and relationships of natural languages by representing them with symbols.
    The main ingredients of symbolic logic are <term>statements</term> and <term>connectives</term>.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-statement">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>statement</term> is an assertion that can be either true or false.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example xml:id="ex-statements-basic">
    <title>Statements</title>
    <p>The following sentences are statements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><em>It is sunny today.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Ms. W will have a broader audience next month.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>I did not join the club.</em></p></li>
    </ul>
  </example>

  <example xml:id="ex-not-statements-basic">
    <title>Non-Statements</title>
    <p>
      Questions (e.g. <em>How’s the weather?</em>), exclamations (e.g. <em>Cool!</em>),
      commands (e.g. <em>Run!</em>), and incomplete sentences (e.g. <em>If I could …</em>)
      are not statements.
    </p>
  </example>

  <p><em>More Examples.</em> Write three statements you often use, and three examples of sentences that are not statements.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-simple-statements">
    <title>Simple Statements</title>

    <p>
      <term>Simple statements</term> do not contain other statements as their parts.
      We represent simple statements using lowercase letters <m>p, q, r, \ldots</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-simple-symbols">
      <title>Symbolic Representation of Simple Statements</title>
      <p>
        For example:
        <m>s</m> = <em>Your bicycle is slick</em> and
        <m>c</m> = <em>Its color is yellow</em>.
      </p>
    </example>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-connectives">
    <title>Connectives</title>

    <definition xml:id="def-connectives">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <term>Connectives</term> join simple statements into more complex statements,
          called <term>compound statements</term>. The most common connectives and their symbols are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Conjunction (and, but): <m>\wedge</m></p></li>
          <li><p>Disjunction (or): <m>\vee</m></p></li>
          <li><p>Conditional (if … then): <m>\rightarrow</m></p></li>
        </ul>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example xml:id="ex-connectives-examples">
      <title>Examples</title>
      <p><m>s \wedge c</m> = <em>Your bicycle is slick and its color is yellow.</em></p>
      <p><m>c \rightarrow s</m> = <em>If its color is yellow then your bicycle is slick.</em></p>
    </example>

    <p><em>More Examples.</em> Write three compound statements and circle the connective(s) in each.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-negation">
    <title>Negation</title>

    <definition xml:id="def-negation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The “operation” <term>not</term>, symbolically written <m>\neg</m>, turns a statement into its negation.
          (Negation is not a connective.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <me>
\begin{aligned}
&amp; p \qquad &amp; p\ \text{is true}\qquad \mathrm{(assertion)}\\
\neg &amp; p \qquad &amp; p\ \text{is false}\qquad \mathrm{(negation)}
\end{aligned}
    </me>

    <example xml:id="ex-negation-example">
      <title>Negation Example</title>
      <p>
        The negation of <m>s</m> = <em>Your bicycle is slick</em> is
        <m>\neg s</m> = <em>Your bicycle is not slick</em>.
      </p>

    <remark xml:id="remark-parentheses-dictionary">
      <title>Remark</title>
      <p>
        The symbols representing statements, the connectives, and negation form our dictionary.
        Parentheses are used for punctuation. Our goal is to convert statements and logical arguments into symbols
        to better understand structure, truth values, and validity.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-connectives-compound-summary">
    <title>Connectives and Compound Statements</title>

    <note xml:id="note-or-inclusive">
      <p>
        The connective <term>or</term> in logic has an <term>inclusive</term> meaning.
        For example, “Bob will play tennis or go to the movies” means Bob may play tennis,
        or go to the movies, or do both.
      </p>
    </note>

    <note xml:id="note-but-and">
      <p>
        The connective <term>but</term> plays the same logical role as <term>and</term> and uses the same symbol <m>\wedge</m>.
        For example, “Your bicycle is slick, but its color is not yellow” is <m>s \wedge \neg c</m>.
      </p>
    </note>

    <p><em>More Examples.</em> When your friend says “We will go to the library or go to a coffee place”:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>What does your friend usually mean?</p></li>
      <li><p>How do we interpret it in logic?</p></li>
      <li><p>Rephrase it to make intentions completely clear.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <title>Parentheses</title>

    <p>
      The use of parentheses is essential. Consider:
      <em>If I search for webpages containing “termites” or “cattle”, then I will search for webpages containing “global warming”.</em>
    </p>

    <p>Define the simple statements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><m>t</m>: I search for webpages containing “termites”.</p></li>
      <li><p><m>c</m>: I search for webpages containing “cattle”.</p></li>
      <li><p><m>g</m>: I search for webpages containing “global warming”.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The symbolic form is:</p>
    <me>(t \vee c) \rightarrow g.</me>

    <warning xml:id="warn-parentheses-ambiguity">
      <p>
        Without parentheses, <m>t \vee c \rightarrow g</m> is ambiguous and can represent a different meaning.
      </p>
    </warning>

    <p>
      <em>More Examples.</em> Compare <m>(t\rightarrow c)\wedge g</m> and <m>t\rightarrow c \wedge g</m> by translating
      each into English. Which one is ambiguous? Remove ambiguity using parentheses.

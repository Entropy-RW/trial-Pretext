  "body": " Statements and Connectives   Goals for This Section   Define simple and compound statements .  Learn fundamental connectives, conjunction, disjunction, and condition .  Learn how to negate statements involving conjunctions, disjunctions, and conditionals.     Statements and Connectives  Symbolic logic studies some parts and relationships of natural language by representing them with symbols. The main ingredients of symbolic logic are statements and connectives .    A statement is an assertion that can be either true or false, but not both.     Statements and Non-Statements  The following sentences are statements:   It is sunny today.  Ms. W. will have a broader audience next month.  I did not join the club.     Non-Statements  The following sentences are NOT statements:   What time is it?  Listen!  .    Questions, interjections (for example, “Cool!”), and incomplete sentences (for example, “If I could …”) are not considered to be statements unless rephrased appropriately.     Simple statements do not contain other statements as parts. All of the examples above are simple statements. We typically represent simple statements using lowercase letters .   Symbolic Representation of Simple Statements  Let represent “Your bicycle is slick,” and represent “I like its color.”      Connectives join simple statements into more complex statements, called compound statements . The most common connectives and their symbols are:   Conjunction (and, but) :  Disjunction (or) :  Conditional (if..., then):      Conjunction  Suppose and represent the following statements:   “Your bicycle is slick,”   “I like its color.”  “Your bicycle is slick and I like its color” is written symbolically as  .   Disjunction  Suppose and represent the following statements:   “Your bicycle is slick,”   “I like its color.”  “Your bicycle is slick or I like its color” is written symbolically as  .   In everyday English, the connective or is sometimes used in an exclusive sense, meaning that exactly one of the options is true. In contrast, the connective or in logic has an inclusive meaning. Thus, the statement “Bob will play tennis or go to the movies” means that Bob may play tennis, or go to the movies, or do both.     The operation not , symbolically written , turns a single statement into its negation. It is not a connective.     The connective but plays the same logical role as and and is represented by the same symbol . For example, “Your bicycle is slick, but I don’t like its color” is written as .   The symbols representing statements, connectives, and negation form our logical dictionary. Parentheses are used for punctuation.   Summary of Statements     Symbol  Meaning     Statement (assertion)     Not (negation)     and (conjunction)     Either or , or both (disjunction)     If then (conditional)       The use of parentheses is essential and requires careful attention. Consider the following compound statement:   The Role of Parentheses  If I do a web search for pages containing the terms “termites” or “cattle,” then I will search for pages containing “global warming.”  Define the simple statements:   : I search for pages containing “termites.”  : I search for pages containing “cattle.”  : I search for pages containing “global warming.”   The symbolic form of the compound statement is .  Without parentheses, the expression would represent a different and unintended meaning.      Exercises  In the following questions, translate between English statements and symbolic logic. You may choose your own letters for simple statements, as long as you define them clearly.   Jim is a lawyer, yet he is not a crook.   Let = “Jim is a lawyer” and = “Jim is a crook.” Then .     Although our professor is young, he is knowledgeable.   Let = “Our professor is young” and = “Our professor is knowledgeable.” Then, the answer is .     My favorite dish has lots of anchovies or is not spicy and also it comes in a large portion.   Let = “My favorite dish has lots of anchovies,” = “My favorite dish is spicy,” and = “My favorite dish comes in a large portion.” Then .     My favorite dish has lots of anchovies and it comes in a large portion or it is spicy and it also comes in a large portion.   Using the same symbols as , the statement is .     If you do not attend class, then either you read a book or you will not pass the exam.   Let = “you attend class,” = “you read a book,” and = “you pass the exam.” Then .     I am doing a web search for pages containing “global warming”, but not for pages containing both “termites” and “cattle”.   Let = “search ‘global warming’,” = “search ‘termites’,” = “search ‘cattle’.” Then .     I am doing a web search for pages containing “global warming”, but not for pages containing “termites” and not for pages containing “cattle”.   Using the same symbols, the statement is .      Exercises  Suppose that   = \"The sunroof is extra,\"   = \"The radial tires are included,\"    = \"Power windows are optional.\"  Convert each of the following statements into words.    .  If the sunroof is extra and the power windows are optional, then the radial tires are included.    Convert into words: .  The radial tires are included, and either the sunroof is extra or the power windows are not optional.    Convert into words: .  If the radial tires are not included, then either the sunroof is not extra or the power windows are not optional.    Convert into words: .  It is not the case that the power windows are optional and the sunroof is extra.    "

  "body": " Truth Tables   Goals for This Section   Learn how to construct truth tables for statements.  Learn tautologies and contradictions .     Truth Tables  Each statement is True T or False F but not both. A truth table summarizes all possible truth values of a statement.    Negation reverses the truth value of a statement.   Truth Table for Negation        T  F    F  T         A conjunction ( ) combines two statements. The only case in which a conjunction is true is when both statements are true .   Truth Table for Conjunction         T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  F         A disjunction ( ) combines two statements. The only case in which a disjunction is false is when both statements are false .   Truth Table for Disjunction         T  T  T    T  F  T    F  T  T    F  F  F        Truth Table Practice   Construct the truth table for the compound statement .    Build the table by computing , then , and finally .

A conditional statement is a compound statement of the form “if then ,” written symbolically as . The statement is called the antecedent (or condition), and the statement is called the consequent .  The only case in which a conditional statement is false is when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false .   Truth Table for Conditional         T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  T    F  F  T        Truth Table Practice   Construct a truth table for the compound statement .

Conditional Statement Variations  A conditional statement of the form can be expressed in several equivalent ways in English. All of the following statements have the same logical meaning.   If , then .  If , .  if .  When , .  when .  is sufficient for .  is necessary for .  only if .     Common Pitfall: “If” vs. “Only If”  A frequent source of confusion is the difference between the phrases if and only if .  The statement “ only if ” means that is necessary for , and is translated symbolically as .  In contrast, the statement “ if ” is translated as .  One helpful rule to remember is:   The phrase only if points to the consequent of a conditional statement.    Rewrite in if, then  The statement “You pass the exam only if you attend class” means that attending class is necessary for passing the exam. Symbolically, this is written as , where = “you pass the exam” and = “you attend class.”     Hidden Conditional Statements in English  Many statements in everyday English do not explicitly use the phrase “if … then …,” but they still express a conditional relationship. Such statements are called hidden conditional statements .  In these cases, the conditional form can be revealed by rewriting the statement in an explicit “if … then …” format.   Example  The statement “No koalas live in South Carolina” can be rewritten as: “If it is a koala, then it does not live in South Carolina.”    Example  The statement “Michael Jordan eats Wheaties” can be rewritten as: “If you are Michael Jordan, then you eat Wheaties.”     Rewriting Statements as Conditionals    Rewrite the following statement using the form if … then … .  Every picture tells a story.    If it is a picture, then it tells a story.      Rewrite the following statement using the form if … then … .  I can come with you only if I can find some time.    If I can come with you, then I can find some time.      Truth Table with Three Variables  Consider the compound statement , which involves three simple statements: , , and .  Compound statements may contain several simple statements. In order to determine how many columns are needed in a truth table, it is helpful to break the compound statement into building blocks of increasing complexity, starting with a column for each simple statement and ending with the compound statement itself.  For this example, the building blocks are:            Truth Table for            T T T  T F T    T T F  T T T    T F T  F F F    T F F  F T T    F T T  F F F    F T F  F T T    F F T  F F F    F F F  F T T     By constructing the truth table one building block at a time, we reduce errors and make the logical structure of the compound statement clear.      Exercises  Construct truth tables for the following compound statements. Include columns for each simple statement and each intermediate component, ending with the compound statement itself.

A contradiction is a statement that are always false.   Tautology and Contradiction   For each statement, construct a truth table (including columns for intermediate components) and use the final column to determine whether the statement is a tautology or a contradiction .      Show that the statement is a tautology by constructing its truth table.     Truth Table for          T T T F T  T F T F T  F T T F F  F F F T T    Since the final column is not always , this statement is not a tautology.

Negating Statements  Negating a statement means forming a new statement that is true exactly when the original statement is false. For compound statements, negation must be handled carefully.  In particular, negating conjunctions and disjunctions follows De Morgan’s Laws , which were justified earlier using truth tables. See for the formal statements.  Negating conditional statements behaves differently and is a common source of confusion. The difference between a conditional and its reversal was explored in .
